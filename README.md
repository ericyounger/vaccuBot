- [x] design a 3D case, and print it
- [x] Mount 3d case, battery and RPI to bracket
- [x] Remote control over VNC
- [x] Ultrasonic sensors, distance measuring, collision avoidance

Planning to implement:
- [ ] Driving corrections, straight line test
- [ ] Vaccum cleaner, building it with a computer fan and tubes
